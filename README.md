Some artificial intelligence tests in java and javascript

It includes:
- A Perceptron. It also includes an html which trains the perceptron to solve the problem of values greater than/lower than
- A multi-layer perceptron that can be trained using backpropagation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation). It also includes an html which trains the mlp to solve the XOR problem
- A multi-layer perceptron that can be trained using a genetic algorithm. It also includes a main method which trains the mlp to solve the XOR problem. The source code is available in java and also javascript. The genetic algorithm is inspired by http://natureofcode.com/.
