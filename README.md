Some artificial intelligence tests in java and javascript

It includes:
- In javascript:
	/ A Perceptron. It also includes an html which trains the perceptron to solve the problem of values greater than/lower than
	/ A multi-layer perceptron that can be trained using backpropagation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation). It has an HTML which solves the XOR problem.
In java:
	/ Libraries:
		+ A library with a multi-layer perceptron. That can be reproduced using a genetic algorithm
	/ Programs:
		+ A multi-layer perceptron trained using a genetic algorithm which solves the XOR problem.
		+ A self-driving car which uses a multi-layer perceptron trained using a genetic algorithm
