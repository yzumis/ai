Some artificial intelligence tests in java and javascript

It includes:
- In javascript:
    - A Perceptron. It also includes an html which trains the perceptron to solve the problem of values greater than/lower than
    - A multi-layer perceptron that can be trained using backpropagation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation). It has an HTML which solves the XOR problem.
- In java:
    - Libraries:
        - mlp --> A library which implements a multi-layer perceptron. It can be reproduced using a genetic algorithm
    - Programs:
        - mlp-ga --> multi-layer perceptron trained using a genetic algorithm which solves the XOR problem.
        - genetic_car --> A self-driving car which uses a multi-layer perceptron trained using a genetic algorithm
        - lstm --> Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural network trained using a genetic algorithm which solves a simple character patern
- Others: contains some experiments non related to artificial intelligence
